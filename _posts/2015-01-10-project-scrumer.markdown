This was one of our first learning projects in language - ruby on rails - with an objective to deploy a functional application on heroku. The idea originated from using an inappropriate software - Google Docs - to keep track of team's work.

Scrumer allows scrum-master to assign tasks to his team everyday and monitor their progress.
